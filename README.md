# countrydelight
Basic Country Delight app

Your task is to go through below templates/stories and create the app.

The tech stack required is Java and Spring Boot. Preferred IDE is Intellij/Eclipse to import the project directly. Postman tool to test the REST APIs.
Make sure maven and .m2 etc are configured on local.
Preferred machine to run the project is the Windows machine because it might be possible that Mac machines (specially M1) do not support some of the jars used.

How to start:
To start the development a template repo is provided at the Github link â€“
https://github.com/azaylamba/countrydelight 
The candidate should make sure Java, Postman & Intellij are already installed on their system before starting the development. They should fork the above repo and clone to their local system. Once it is cloned, they should import the project in intellij and start development.
To check the hosted app in the browser, they can search for http://localhost:8000/ in their browser or postman app after running the main class in IDE.

For persistence of data, H2 database should be used which is in-memory database and dependency for the same is already added in POM. If you are comfortable with any other in-memory database like SQLite or some other, feel free to add the dependency and use that.


H2-Database
Database is automatically configured with a sample table BILLIONAIRES. H2 Console can be accessed with below credentials.
username=sa
password=password
Console link - http://localhost:8080/h2-console
Default JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
How to connect to JDBC: http://www.h2database.com/html/tutorial.html#connecting_using_jdbc
